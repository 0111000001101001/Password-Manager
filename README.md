# password-manager
This Python-based Password Manager, developed in VS Code, provides a user-friendly way to store, manage, and generate passwords. It uses SQLite for database management and offers functionalities for creating, updating, deleting, and listing password entries. As a beginner programmer, I tried my best to implement conventional coding practices to improve readability and maintainability. Some features are yet to be implemented.

### Requirements:

- Pyperclip
```
pip install pyperclip
```
- Tabulate
```
pip install tabulate
```
- VS Code - SQLite  Viewer extension
