## password-manager
Password manager and generator developed with **Python and SQLite** in VS Code. Some features are yet to be implemented. I made use of the <ins>**SQLite Viewer**</ins> extension to read the generated database. 

Credentials for the program:

>username: admin
>
>password: adminpassword

This is my first passion project, and I had a lot of fun working on it :)
